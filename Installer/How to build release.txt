For a release build, do this:

1. Update the SVN to the correct revision and note the revision number
2. Run the UpdateVersionNumber.exe and set the revision number
3. Rebuild the solution in Release mode
4. Update the revision number in "UpgradeData.wxi"
5. Run "VS Express build.bat"
6. Go to folder bin\Release
7. Rename "Duplicati.msi" to "Duplicati 1.0 r???.msi"
8. Rename "Duplicati.zip" to "Duplicati 1.0 r???.zip"
9. Verify that the "Run application now" works in the MSI

If the zip file is missing, you need to install 7zip.
If the msi file is missing, you need to install the .Net SDK 2.0.
