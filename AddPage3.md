If you want to backup your documents, check the appropriate boxes. Note that you cannot backup files across drives, so if your machine has multiple drives, you may not be able to backup everything in a single backup. Duplicati will inform you if your selection is invalid.

If you want to specify exactly what folder to back up, check the "A specific folder" radiobutton. Then click the browse button ("...") and select the folder you wish to back up. Duplicati will calculate the size of the files in that folder.

Duplicati will attempt to calculate the size of the files that will be backed up, so if you wait a little, you can see this a the bottom of the page. The actual backups are usually smaller, because the files are compressed.

When you are done, click the "Next >" button.
