On this page you must select where to store the backups.

If you have a network drive, you can either browse to it, or type in the full path.

If you have attached an USB drive, you can select it on the list below, browse to it, or type in the path manually.

If you choose a network folder, you may have to log on to the destination. If that is the case, enter the credentials
