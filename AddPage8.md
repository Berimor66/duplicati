In the fields "Run the backup at this time", you may enter the time when Duplicati should run your backups. You can use this to start the backups at a time when the computer is on, but you are not using it. If you work at an office, you could select the time when you are out to lunch.

It is very important that backups are always up to date. There is no point in having a backup from last year, if you need the file you edited yesterday. In the "Repeat the backup regularly" you can enter how often you want the backup to automatically run.

You can choose one of the predefined intervals, or enter a custom interval. The syntax for custom intervals is a bit special, but easy to learn.
If you want to backup up every day, enter "1D" for one day. You can also enter "3M" for each three months. You can even combine them with "1M3D" or "14D1M". You can use "Y" for years, "M" for months, "W" for weeks, "D" for days, "h" for hours, "m" for minutes and "s" for seconds.

The setting you choose depend on how often you modify the files. A common setting is "Each day" (1D), which is also the default.

When you are done, click the "Next >" button.
