On this page you can choose to display pages with some of the more advanced options that Duplicati offers.
You are free to ignore this page entirely, and just click next.

For the purpose of this guide, I will check all the boxes, and walk through the entire guide.

[Click here to skip the advanced options >>](AddPage12.md).

If the last checkbox is checked, Duplicati will add the entire setup database to each backup.
This will make the backups slightly larger, but if you loose all your data (eg. the machine is stolen),
you can simply point Duplicati to the same place, and it will restore all the settings.

When you are done, click the "Next >" button.
