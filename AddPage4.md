If you store your backups, there is the posibility that someone will read it. This is especially true if you do not own the server where you store it. Even if you own the server or disk where it is stored, it could get stolen.

To protect against other people reading your backups, you can encrypt the backups. You should choose a passphrase that is both long and hard to guess. The button "Generate password" will generate a strong password for you. **Be sure to keep a copy of the password**. No one can restore your backups if the password is lost!

If you prefer, you can use the GnuPG program to encrypt data, rather than the built-in AES encryption.
On the very first run, Duplicati will automatically check the option to use the same settings on subsequent backups.

_Even if this step seems difficult, it is very important that you enter a password AND WRITE IT DOWN!._

When you are done, click the "Next >" button.
