The very first time you use Duplicati, you will be greeted with a special page.

![http://duplicati.googlecode.com/svn/images/Screenshots/Add/Page1a.png](http://duplicati.googlecode.com/svn/images/Screenshots/Add/Page1a.png)

On this page you must select the "Setup a new backup" option. If
you loose your data or your machine later, you can restore the setup,
by selecting the "Restore settings from a previous Duplicati installation" option.

[<< Go to previous page](AddingBackup.md) - [Go to next page >>](AddPage2.md)

If you start the wizard again later, you will see the normal setup page.

On this page, you must select the "Schedule new backup" option, and then click "Next >"
