On this page you must select what type of storage you want to use.

  * An external disk or network drive
  * FTP to a remote server
  * SSH (SFTP) to a remote server
  * Amazon S3 storage

If you want to store files on an external harddisk, you can use the first option. If you have a place to store the files, you can use the FTP or SSH option.

If you want to store a backup outside your house, I clearly recommend Amazon S3. It is cheap and very stable, but requires that you set up an account. There is a link to that on the setup page.

When you have chosen the storage destination, click the "Next >" button.
