On this page you must select where to store the backups.

In the server field, you must enter the hostname of the server that will store the backups.
In the path field, you can enter the name of a folder where the files will be stored.
The username and password field are used to log into the server.
If you use passwordless login (eg. by using pageant on windows), remove the check mark for the password.
The port is usually the default 22, but may be changed.

All the information required on this page should be avalible from the SSH service provider.

The test button will test the connection, and thus reduce the chance that the information contains errors.

When you are done, click the "Next >" button. If you have not already tested the connection, Duplicati will ask you if it should be tested before you continue.
