********** Duplicati v. {0} **********

Usage:

 Backup (make a full or incremental backup):
  Duplicati.CommandLine [full] [options] <sourcefolder> <backend>

 Restore (restore all or some files):
  Duplicati.CommandLine [options] <backend> <destinationfolder>

 Cleanup (remove partial and unused files):
  Duplicati.CommandLine cleanup [options] <backend>

 List files (backup volumes):
  Duplicati.CommandLine list [options] <backend>

 List content files (backed up files):
  Duplicati.CommandLine list-current-files [options] <backend>

 Purge signature cache:
  Duplicati.CommandLine purge-signature-cache [options]

 Delete old backups:
  Duplicati.CommandLine delete-all-but-n-full <number of full backups to keep> [options] <backend>
  Duplicati.CommandLine delete-older-than <max allowed age> [options] <backend>


 A <backend> is identified by an url like ftp://host/ or ssh://server/.
 Using this system, Duplicati can detect if you want to backup or restore.
 The cleanup and delete command does not delete files, unless the --force option is specified, so you may examine what files are affected, before actually deleting the files.
 The cleanup command should not be used unless a backup was interrupted and has left partial files. Duplicati will inform you if this happens.
 The delete commands can be used to remove backup sets when newer backups are present.

Option types:
 The following option types are avalible:
  Integer: a numerical value
  Boolean: a truth value, --force and --force=true are equivalent. --force=false is the oposite
  Timespan: a time in the special time format
  Size: a size like 5mb or 200kb
  Enumeration: any of the listed values
  Path: the path to a folder or file
  String: any other type

Times:
 Duplicati uses the time system from duplicity, where times may be presented as:
  1: the string "now", indicating the current time
  2: the number of seconds after epoch, eg: 123456890
  3: a string like "2009-03-26T08:30:00+01:00"
  4: an interval string, using Y, M, W, D, h, m, s for Year, Month, Week, Day, hour, minute or second, eg: "1M4D" for one month and four days, or "5m" for five minutes.

Filters:
 Duplicati uses filters to include and exclude files.
  Duplicati uses a "first-touch" filter where the first rule that matches a file determines if the file is included or excluded. Internally Duplciati uses regular expression filters, but supports filters in the form of filename globbing. The order of the commandline arguments also determine what order they are applied in. An example:
    --include=*.txt --exclude=*\Thumbs.db --include=*

  Even though the last filter includes everything, no files named "Thumbs.db" are included because they match the exclude rule before the include rule. Paths are evaluated as paths that are releative to folder being backed up, but including a leading slash. An example:

{1}
  If a folder is excluded, files in that folder are always excluded, even if there are filters that include files in that folder. If a folder is included with a wildcard at the end, all files are included, if the folder is included without a wildcard, files may be excluded or included with extra rules.
